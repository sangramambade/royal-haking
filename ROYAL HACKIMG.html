    <h1 style="color: rgb(24, 172, 24);">A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to
        overcome a technical problem. The term also may refer to anyone who uses their abilities to gain unauthorized
        access to systems or networks in order to commit crimes. A hacker may, for example, steal information to hurt
        people via identity theft or bring down a system and, often, hold it hostage in order to collect a ransom.

        The term hacker has historically been a divisive one, sometimes being used as a term of admiration for
        individuals who exhibit a high degree of skill and creativity in their approach to technical problems. However,
        the term is also commonly applied to individuals who use this skill for illegal or unethical purposes.

        Hacker was first used in the 1960s to describe a programmer or an individual who, in an era of highly
        constrained computer capabilities, could increase the efficiency of computer code in a way that removed, or
        hacked, excess machine code instructions from a program. It has evolved over the years to refer to someone with
        an advanced understanding of computers, networking, programming or hardware.</h1>
